De Novo Signature Extraction

Purpose: To uncover novel or context-specific mutational processes without prior assumptions.
Approach: Uses unsupervised method of Non-negative Matrix Factorization (NMF) to decompose a matrix of mutation counts into:
- Signatures (patterns)
- Exposures (how much of each signature is present in each sample)
Input: Catalog of somatic mutations, categorized as 96 trinucleotide SBS types.
Output: A set of mutational signatures and their contributions across samples.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Input Parameters:

num_processesToExtract - integer, number of mutational signatures to extract
num_totIterations - integer, total number of iterations (bootstrapping)
num_parallelCores - integer, number of cores to use for the analysis
thresh_removeWeakMutTypes - numeric, threshold for filtering out under-represented mutation types
thresh_removeLastPercent - numeric, threshold for removing outlier iteration results
distanceFunction - string, method for calculating distances. Default method is "cosine"
num_totReplicates - integer, number of replicates while checking stability
eps - numeric, close-to-zero positive numeric value for replacing zeros and preventing negative values to appear in the matrix during NMF
stopconv - integer, max number of stable iterations before termination. Defaults to 20000.
niter - integer, max number of iterations to run. Defaults to 1000000
guided - logical, shall clustering be guided to improve aggregation upon bootstrapping
debug - logical, shall the analysis be run in DEBUG mode
approach - string, indicating whether to model absolute counts ("counts") or per_mille frequency ("freq"). Defaults to "freq".
stopRule - string, use the sub-optimal termination rule ("AL") from the WTSI package (actually, iterations won't terminate, so niter will most certainly reached) or our efficient termination rule ("DF"). Defaults to "DF". The "AL" option is implemented for compatibility reasons, but not recommended.
algorithm - string, algorithm to be used for NMF. Set to "brunet", or "alexa" for using the standard algorithm (Brunet's), otherwise the alternative "chihjen" algorithm will be used.
logIterations - string indicating if storing and returining all intermediates, or only final results. Defaults to "lite", i.e. returns full output and limited intermediates. Alternatively, set to "full".
seed - integer, seed to set for reproducibility

Refitting to Known Signatures

Purpose: To quantify the contribution of known mutational signatures from COSMIC in each sample.
Approach: Matches the observed mutational profile of a sample to the closest combination of known signatures using least-squares fitting.
Input: Mutation catalog and a predefined set of known signatures.
Output: Signature exposures per sample (how much each known signature contributes).
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Input Parameters:

sig_db - one of signatures catalog versions "legacy", "SBS", "DBS", "ID", "TSB", "SBS_Nik_lab", "RS_Nik_lab", "RS_BRCA560", "RS_USARC", "CNS_USARC", "CNS_TCGA", "CNS_TCGA176", "CNS_PCAWG176", "SBS_hg19", "SBS_hg38", "SBS_mm9", "SBS_mm10", "DBS_hg19", "DBS_hg38", "DBS_mm9", "DBS_mm10", "SBS_Nik_lab_Organ", "RS_Nik_lab_Organ", "latest_SBS_GRCh37", "latest_DBS_GRCh37", "latest_ID_GRCh37", "latest_SBS_GRCh38", "latest_DBS_GRCh38", "latest_SBS_mm9", "latest_DBS_mm9", "latest_SBS_mm10", "latest_DBS_mm10", "latest_SBS_rn6", "latest_DBS_rn6", "latest_CN_GRCh37", "latest_RNA-SBS_GRCh37", "latest_SV_GRCh38".

All other inputs parameters are automatically preset - there is no need for setting them manually for this analysis approach.
